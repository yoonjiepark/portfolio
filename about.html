            <p>
                hi! my name is yoonjie park, and i'm a human-centred product designer
                from seoul, south korea.
            </p>
            <p>
                i'm a masters student at northwestern university studying engineering
                and design innovation. for my undergraduate degree, i studied
                manufacturing and design engineering and psychology. with my roots in
                journalism, i continue to write for articles for various publications in
                my free time.
            </p>
            <p>
                with my hybrid background of technical engineering and user
                understanding, i hope to design products that solve real problems that
                real people have.
            </p>
            <p>
                when i'm not working in the design studio, i enjoy exploring new places,
                challenging myself in escape rooms and spending time with my family,
                friends and my dog.
